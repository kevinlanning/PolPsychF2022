<h3>basics</h3>
<p>This is POS 4206 Section 1. It is a 3 credit class offered in the
<strong>Fall 2022</strong> term. The class meets <strong>MW 930-1150 in
AD 205</strong>. There is no lab.</p>
<p>The professor is Kevin Lanning. My office hours are <strong>M
3-5</strong> (in person, WB 105) and <strong>F 1230-2</strong>
(virtually, via Zoom). You may schedule virtual appointments at <a
href="https://calendly.com/kevin-lanning"
class="uri">https://calendly.com/kevin-lanning</a>. My office phone is
(561) 594-1018, but it is quicker to reach me via email at <a
href="mailto:lanning@fau.edu" class="email">lanning@fau.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>course description:</strong> Political psychology is an
intermediate-level undergraduate class which lies at the intersection of
political science and psychology. The scope of political psychology is
broad. Psychology and politics meet in the decisions of voters and in
the deliberations of diplomats, in the design of ballots and in the
personality of Presidents, in the construction of campaign ads and in
the life histories of conservatives and liberals, in traits such as
Narcissism, Social Dominance, Machiavellianism, and Authoritarianism, in
the responsibilities of a clinical psychologist charged with counseling
enemy combatants at Guantanamo, and, perhaps most critically, in actions
such as your own casting of a ballot in this year’s election.</p>
<p>Today, the idea of “political psychology” is increasingly central in
the liberal arts. What is truth, and how can we find and share it? What
is civility, and how do we reconcile our respect for each other as
individuals with deeper values such as freedom and equality? What is
leadership, and what responsibilities does it carry? Who am I, and to
what extent is my identity linked with my social and political
attitudes? How shall I live my life, and how much of it do I want to
devote to political participation and public service?</p>
<p><strong>course instructional method:</strong> In-person.</p>
<p><strong>course prerequisites / co-requisites</strong>: Prerequisites
are POS 1041 or PSY 1012 or permission of instructor. There are no
co-requisites.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives-student-learning-outcomes"
class="section level3">
<h3>course objectives / student learning outcomes</h3>
<p>In the seminar, the primary goal is to introduce students to the
field of political psychology from perspectives of psychology and
politics. From a psychological perspective, this will include
perspectives on personality (including the personality of leaders),
emotions (including fear and hate), social psychology (the role of
situations and group influences), cognitive psychology (persuasion and
political decision making), and developmental psychology (including the
predictability of ideology from childhood). From a political science
perspective, our focus will primarily be on American Government, but we
may also consider issues in International Relations (such as conflict
resolution), and in Political Theory (how forms of government including
democracy interact with the self-concept).</p>
<p>A second goal, woven throughout the term, is to introduce students to
the broad range of (often clever) methods used in research in political
psychology.</p>
<p>A third goal in the course is to provide a social scientific context
for biennial elections, that is, to help students understand candidates
and campaigns at a deeper level, and so to become more informed
citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth goal is to foster in you a sense of citizenship and
social responsibility and an appreciation of the virtue of political
participation.</p>
<p><strong>note of honors distinction:</strong> The course receives
honors credit by virtue of its small class size, by virtue of a
dialectic approach in the classroom structure, and by the fact that
students receive extensive exposure to supplementary materials and
primary sources. This course differs substantially from a non-Honors
course in that (a) the expectations for participation in class
discussions will be greater than in a typical undergraduate course with
a larger number of students, (b) class projects will be undertaken in
heterogeneous groups in which students will be teaching and learning
from their peers as well as the instructor, (c) students receive
extensive exposure to primary research articles.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-assessments-assignments-grading-policy"
class="section level3">
<h3>course assessments, assignments, &amp; grading policy</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on exams, a term paper, and classroom
performance, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>From in-class quizzes, 15%</strong> Some classes will begin
with a brief quiz asking questions such as (a) which paper(s) or
chapter(s) have you read, (b) how much time you spent reading, (c) a
comment or question that you would like to share with the class, and (d)
whether this is a topic that you would like to study in more depth.</p>
<p><strong>From class participation, 15%.</strong> You can earn class
participation points by (a) attending class, (b) by making contributions
to discussion which indicate that you have thoughtfully studied the
assignments in a timely fashion, and (c) by listening to and selectively
reinforcing the best comments of your peers.</p>
<p><strong>From a collaboratively-written paper, 20%.</strong> Learning
is social. In the first half of the class, you will be asked to write a
collaborative paper with two to four of your peers. In order for me to
assess your individual contributions and to minimize social loafing, I
ask that (1) all writing be done on Google docs, and (2) in addition to
the paper, that all group members sign a 1-page cover page describing
the primary contribution and percent effort of each person. We’ll work
together on creating groups that will, hopefully, maximize synergies
among you, that is, how much you learn from each other as well as the
quality of the final paper itself.</p>
<p><strong>From a class project, 30%.</strong> The project will have two
parts, (a) helping to lead a discussion and (b) writing a brief paper.
For the presentation, you will be expected to help lead one class (with
me and one or more of your classmates) during the second half of the
term. Typically, this will involve sharing one or more insights that you
have gained from a close reading of one of the papers. You will need to
work with your classmates to make sure that there is a minimum of
duplication in the points that you will be presenting. The paper will be
between 4 - 6 pages in length and will expand on this topic. Topics will
be typically chosen from sections A-H in the list of readings. In some
cases, your collaboratively or individually written papers will be the
first step towards your undergraduate honors thesis. (In the library,
you can find a number of undergraduate theses on political psychology
from WHC alumni, including Scott Bush, Joe Colucci, Sam Montgomery,
Marina Perez, Ari Rosenberg, and Melissa Stephan).</p>
<p><strong>From a final examination, 20%.</strong> The final examination
may include multiple-choice questions as well as essays. A sample final
exam study sheet can be found in the files section of Canvas.</p>
<p><strong>Extra credit, 0 - 5%.</strong> You may earn extra credit by
working with political campaigns or otherwise fostering civic
engagement, (e.g., by helping register voters or taking steps to reduce
the spread of misinformation). You will need to provide evidence of this
on a Google Form by the last day of class.</p>

<h3>language about free speech, objectivity, academic freedom, and
interpersonal trust (added in response to Florida HB7)</h3>
<p><strong>language recommended by the FAU Provost’s office</strong>
“One of the objectives of this course is to facilitate critical thinking
and debate around topics, theories, and concepts where disagreement is
not only anticipated, but encouraged. The ability to think critically,
express your ideas clearly, and respond to the professor and other
students civilly are the keystones of the academic experience. In this
course, the professor will provide instruction in an objective manner
and will remain open to a wide variety of viewpoints, so long as those
viewpoints are evidence-based and presented in a respectful way. During
class, the professor may take positions and make statements for the sole
purpose of accomplishing an academic objective or enhancing the learning
environment. Additionally, the adoption of class materials for this
course does not imply an endorsement of the full content of those
materials or the positions of the authors of those materials. Often the
professor will provide materials as a point of departure for critical
thinking and debate. Students should keep in mind that the ideas
presented or discussed during class may not necessarily reflect the
professor’s personal beliefs or opinions on the subject matter.”</p>
<p><strong>language recommended by the United Faculty of
Florida</strong> “Students are encouraged to employ critical thinking
and to rely on data and verifiable sources to interrogate all assigned
readings and subject matter in this course as a way of determining
whether they agree with their classmates and/or their instructor. No
lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a
particular feeling, perception, viewpoint or belief.”</p>
<p><strong>a personal comment</strong> It is critical that the
interpersonal trust and appreciation for human dignity that characterize
the campus community and frame our classroom discourse remain
intact.</p>

<div id="additional-selected-university-college-policies"
class="section level3">
<h3>additional selected university &amp; college policies</h3>
<p><strong>incomplete grade policy:</strong> University policy states
that a student who is passing a course, but has not completed all work
due to exceptional circumstances, may, with consent of the instructor,
temporarily receive a grade of incomplete (“I”). The assignment of the
“I” grade is at the discretion of the instructor, but is allowed only if
the student is passing the course.</p>
<p><strong>attendance policy:</strong> Students are expected to attend
all of their scheduled University classes and to satisfy all academic
objectives as outlined by the instructor. The effect of absences upon
grades is determined by the instructor, and the University reserves the
right to deal at any time with individual cases of non-attendance.
Students are responsible for arranging to make up work missed because of
legitimate class absence, such as illness, family emergencies, military
obligation, court-imposed legal obligations or participation in
University-approved activities. Examples of University-approved reasons
for absences include participating on an athletic or scholastic team,
musical and theatrical performances and debate activities. It is the
student’s responsibility to give the instructor notice prior to any
anticipated absences and within a reasonable amount of time after an
unanticipated absence, ordinarily by the next scheduled class meeting.
Instructors must allow each student who is absent for a
University-approved reason the opportunity to make up work missed
without any reduction in the student’s final course grade as a direct
result of such absence.</p>
<p><strong>time commitment per credit hour:</strong> This course has
three (3) credit hours. For traditionally delivered courses, not less
than one (1) hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction each week
is expected for fifteen (15) weeks per Fall or Spring semester, and a
minimum of two (2) hours of out-of-class student work for each credit
hour. Equivalent time and effort is required for Summer Semesters, which
usually have a shortened timeframe. Fully online courses, hybrid,
shortened, intensive format courses, and other non-traditional modes of
delivery will demonstrate equivalent time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>classroom etiquette/disruptive behavior policy
statement:</strong> Disruptive behavior is defined in the FAU Student
Code of Conduct as “… activities which interfere with the educational
mission within classroom.” Students who disrupt the educational
experiences of other students and/or the instructor’s course objectives
in a face-to-face or online course are subject to disciplinary action.
Such behavior impedes students’ ability to learn or an instructor’s
ability to teach. Disruptive behavior may include, but is not limited to
non-approved use of electronic devices (including cellular telephones);
cursing or shouting at others in such a way as to be disruptive; or,
other violations of an instructor’s expectations for classroom conduct.
For more information, please see the <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/studentconduct/">FAU Office of Student
Conduct</a>.</p>
<p><strong>code of academic integrity policy statement:</strong>
Students at Florida Atlantic University should endeavor to maintain the
highest ethical standards. Academic dishonesty is a serious breach of
these ethical standards, because it interferes with the University
mission to provide a high quality education in which no student enjoys
an unfair advantage over any other. Academic dishonesty is also
destructive to the university community, which is grounded in a system
of mutual trust and places high value on personal integrity and
individual responsibility. Harsh penalties are associated with academic
dishonesty. For more information, see <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/regulations/chapter4/4.001_Code_of_Academic_Integrity.pdf">University
Regulation 4.001</a> and the WHC code at <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/honors/academics/honor-code.php"
class="uri">http://www.fau.edu/honors/academics/honor-code.php</a>.</p>
<p><a
href="http://libguides.fau.edu/c.php?g=325629&amp;p=2352760"><strong>Plagiarism</strong></a>
is the deliberate use and appropriation of another’s work without
identifying the source and trying to pass off such work as one’s own.
Any student who fails to give full credit for ideas or materials taken
from another has plagiarized. This includes all discussion board posts,
journal entries, wikis, and other written and oral presentation
assignments. Plagiarism is unacceptable in the University community.
Academic work must be an original work of your own thought, research, or
self-expression. When students borrow ideas, wording, or organization
from another source, they must acknowledge that fact in an appropriate
manner. If in doubt, cite your source.</p>
<p><strong>disability (accessibility) policy statement:</strong> In
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act
(ADAAA), students who require reasonable accommodations due to a
disability to properly execute coursework must register with Student
