### Spring 2021

This site (https://kevinlanning.github.io/DataSciSpring2021/) hosts course materials for the Wilkes Honors College (WHC) *Intro to Data Science* course in Spring 2021, taught by Professor Kevin Lanning. It is a work in progress, and will be continuously revised throughout the term.

The files which were used to generate this site reside on https://github.com/kevinlanning/DataSciSpring2021. It was created using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), with assistance from a [post by Aleszu Bajak](http://www.storybench.org/convert-google-doc-rmarkdown-publish-github-pages/).

### some additional resources

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) has generously provided full access to their entire online curriculum for students in this class.   

The Data Science Specialization at Coursera is not free, but you may nonetheless find it worthwhile   (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

If you use these (or other) resources, please let your classmates know.
